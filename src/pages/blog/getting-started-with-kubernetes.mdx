# Getting Started with Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is widely used in cloud-native environments to manage applications in containers.

## Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is designed to manage containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It automates various aspects like deployment, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring, making it essential for production-grade containerized applications.

### Key Features:
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatically scale your applications based on resource usage.
- **Self-healing:** If a container fails, Kubernetes can restart or replace it.
- **Load balancing:** Distributes traffic to healthy containers across a cluster.
- **Declarative configuration:** Kubernetes allows you to define the desired state of your application and ensures it matches the real-world state.

## Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes follows a **client-server** model and consists of several key components:

### Master Node
The **master node** is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster, coordinating workloads, and maintaining the desired state of the cluster.

- **API Server:** The central control point for the cluster. Exposes the Kubernetes API and is responsible for the entire cluster's state.
- **Controller Manager:** Responsible for ensuring that the desired state of the cluster is met (e.g., managing deployments, replicas, etc.).
- **Scheduler:** Schedules pods (containers) on available worker nodes.
- **Etcd:** A key-value store that holds the cluster's configuration data.

### Worker Node
A **worker node** runs the containers and executes the tasks assigned by the master node.

- **Kubelet:** An agent that runs on each worker node and ensures the containers are running as expected.
- **Kube-Proxy:** Handles network routing for services and ensures load balancing.
- **Container Runtime:** Runs the containerized applications (e.g., Docker, containerd).

## Setting Up Kubernetes

### Prerequisites:
1. A Linux/macOS/Windows machine or cloud instance.
2. **kubectl:** Command-line tool to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Minikube:** A tool to create a local Kubernetes cluster (useful for development and testing).
4. **Docker:** Required to build container images.

### Installation on Local Machine (Using Minikube)

1. Install **Minikube**:
    ```bash
    # For macOS
    brew install minikube

    # For Linux
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
    sudo mv minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
    ```

2. Start Minikube:
    ```bash
    minikube start
    ```

3. Install **kubectl**:
    ```bash
    brew install kubectl  # macOS

    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.24.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl  # Linux
    ```

4. Verify Kubernetes is running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

## Basic Kubernetes Concepts

### Pod
A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It can host one or more containers that share the same network and storage resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
