# Getting Started with Kubernetes: A Beginner's Guide

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration in modern cloud-native applications. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of Kubernetes and how to get started with your first deployment.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Key Concepts

### 1. Pods
- Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or more containers
- Share network namespace and storage
- Have a unique IP address

### 2. Deployments
- Manage the lifecycle of pods
- Handle rolling updates and rollbacks
- Ensure desired state maintenance
- Support scaling operations

### 3. Services
- Provide stable network endpoints
- Load balance traffic to pods
- Support service discovery
- Enable external access

### 4. ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Store configuration data
- Manage sensitive information
- Decouple configuration from code
- Support dynamic updates

## Your First Deployment

Here's a complete example of deploying a web application with configuration:

```yaml
# ConfigMap for application configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: web-config
data:
  APP_COLOR: blue
  APP_PORT: "80"

---
# Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: web-config
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"

---
# Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

## Basic kubectl Commands

```bash
# View all resources
kubectl get all

# Describe a specific resource
kubectl describe deployment web-app

# View logs
kubectl logs deployment/web-app

# Scale deployment
kubectl scale deployment web-app --replicas=5

# Update image
kubectl set image deployment/web-app nginx=nginx:1.19
```

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
   - Always set resource requests and limits
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Use horizontal pod autoscaling

2. **High Availability**
   - Deploy multiple replicas
   - Use pod anti-affinity
   - Implement health checks

3. **Security**
   - Use RBAC for access control
   - Implement network policies
   - Regularly update images

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up prometheus for metrics
   - Use logging solutions
   - Implement alerts
