# Understanding Kubernetes Cluster Components

## Control Plane Components

### 1. kube-apiserver
The API server is the primary management point for the cluster:
- Validates and processes REST requests
- Updates etcd with cluster state
- Enables communication between all components
- Handles authentication and authorization

### 2. etcd
The cluster's consistent and highly-available key-value store:
- Stores all cluster data
- Handles leader election
- Maintains configuration data
- Ensures state consistency

### 3. kube-scheduler
Responsible for pod scheduling decisions:
- Watches for new pods
- Assigns pods to nodes
- Considers:
  - Resource requirements
  - Hardware constraints
  - Software constraints
  - Node affinity/anti-affinity

### 4. kube-controller-manager
Runs core control loops:
- Node Controller
- Replication Controller
- Endpoints Controller
- Service Account Controller
- Token Controller

## Node Components

### 1. kubelet
The node agent:
- Ensures containers run in pods
- Manages container lifecycle
- Reports node and pod status
- Handles volume mounting

### 2. kube-proxy
The network proxy:
- Implements Services concept
- Manages pod networking
- Handles load balancing
- Maintains network rules

### 3. Container Runtime
The software that runs containers:
- containerd
- CRI-O
- Docker Engine

## Add-on Components

### 1. CoreDNS
Provides DNS services:
- Service discovery
- Pod DNS resolution
- Cluster DNS

### 2. Metrics Server
Collects resource metrics:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Supports autoscaling

## Component Interaction Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web
    image: nginx:latest
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
```

When this Pod is created:
1. API Server validates the request
2. etcd stores the Pod configuration
3. Scheduler assigns the Pod to a node
4. kubelet creates the container
5. kube-proxy sets up networking

## Best Practices

1. **High Availability**
   - Deploy multiple control plane nodes
   - Use etcd cluster with odd number of members
   - Configure proper backup strategies

2. **Security**
   - Enable RBAC
   - Use TLS everywhere
   - Rotate certificates regularly

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor all components
   - Set up alerts for component failures
   - Keep components updated
