# Kubernetes Deployment Strategies

Kubernetes offers a variety of deployment strategies to help you manage how applications are rolled out, updated, and scaled within the cluster. Understanding deployment strategies is critical for ensuring that your applications are both resilient and efficient. These strategies help in achieving zero downtime, rollback capability, and scaling adjustments based on demand.

In this section, we will dive deeper into different deployment strategies in Kubernetes, how they work, and how to use them effectively.

## Rolling Update

The **Rolling Update** strategy is the default deployment strategy in Kubernetes. It allows you to update the application without downtime by incrementally replacing old versions of pods with new ones.

### Key Features:
- **Zero Downtime**: Ensures continuous availability by updating pods in a controlled manner.
- **Control Over Deployment**: You can control the pace of the update with parameters like `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable`.
- **Automatic Rollback**: Kubernetes can automatically roll back to a previous stable version if the deployment fails.

### How it Works:
- Kubernetes replaces a few pods at a time, maintaining a specified number of replicas to ensure availability.
- The update proceeds only if the new version is healthy; otherwise, it stops and rolls back the changes.

#### Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1         # Allows 1 additional pod to be created during the update
      maxUnavailable: 1   # Allows 1 pod to be unavailable during the update
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app:v2
