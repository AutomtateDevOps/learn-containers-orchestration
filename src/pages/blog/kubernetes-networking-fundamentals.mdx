# Kubernetes Networking Fundamentals

## Core Networking Concepts

### Pod Networking
- Each Pod gets its own IP address
- All containers within a Pod share the network namespace
- Containers within a Pod can communicate via localhost

### Service Types
1. **ClusterIP**: Internal-only access
2. **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each node's IP
3. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally
4. **ExternalName**: Maps to an external DNS name

## Network Policies

Network Policies are like firewalls for Pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: api-allow
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

## Service Discovery

Services provide stable endpoints for Pods:
- DNS-based discovery
- Environment variables
- Service mesh integration

## Load Balancing
- Internal load balancing with Services
- External load balancing with Ingress
- Session affinity options
